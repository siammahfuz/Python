Python
Welcome to the Python Programming repository!

Python is a powerful, high-level programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and vast ecosystem. It is widely used in web development, data science, automation, artificial intelligence, scripting, and more. This repository serves as a structured learning resource to explore the fundamental and intermediate concepts of Python programming.

📌 About This Repository
This project is designed to help beginners and intermediate learners understand the core concepts of Python through simple and practical examples. The programs here reflect my personal learning journey, written using approaches that aim to make learning intuitive and accessible.

Whether you're a student starting with Python or an experienced developer exploring new topics, this repository provides hands-on practice and real-world use cases.

🧠 What You'll Learn
Python syntax and basic structure

Variables, data types, and operators

Control flow: if-else, loops

Functions, parameters, and return values

Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets

File handling and exception management

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Modules and packages

Introduction to libraries (e.g., math, datetime, random)

(Optional/Coming Soon): Web development with Flask/Django, data analysis with Pandas/NumPy
